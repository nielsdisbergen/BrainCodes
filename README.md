This repository contains brain imaging analysis and processing related codes. All codes have been developed for personal use, hence they are not generallizable under all conditions, do not provide exhaustive error and input checking, nor are they fully optimized for speed. Please employ codes accordingly.

In case you have any questions, problems, or suggestions, feel free to contact me or open an issue.
